# Machine-Learning-Engineer
This repository documents my journey to becoming a Machine Learning Engineer. I’ll be posting regular updates here as I progress.

I will soon upload the roadmap that i followed for it but that would be uploaded once i get a job in a top MNC as ML engineer otherwise there is no point to it. It will take about 8 months to do so. I am confident that this time i will do it.
